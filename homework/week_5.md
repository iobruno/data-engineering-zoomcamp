## Week 5 Homework 

In this homework we'll put what we learned about Spark in practice.
For this homework we will be using the FHVHV 2021-06 data found here. [FHVHV Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhvhv/fhvhv_tripdata_2021-06.csv.gz )


### Question 1: 

**Install Spark and PySpark** 

- Install Spark
- Run PySpark
- Create a local spark session
- Execute spark.version.

What's the output?
- [X] 3.3.2
- [ ] 2.1.4
- [ ] 1.2.3
- [ ] 5.4
